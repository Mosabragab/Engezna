## 🎯 Project Overview

### **Problem Statement**
Beni Suef and Upper Egypt lack modern food delivery infrastructure. Existing national platforms (Talabat, Noon) don't serve the region adequately with their high 15-20% commission rates, leaving a gap for:
- Customers who want convenient food delivery
- Local restaurants seeking online presence and affordable platform fees
- Local economy needing digital transformation

### **Solution**
A localized, bilingual (Arabic/English) food delivery platform that:
- Connects customers with local restaurants and shops
- **Providers use their existing delivery staff** (no driver app needed)
- **Ultra-low commission** (5-7% vs competitors' 15-20%)
- Supports Arabic-first user experience with RTL design
- Offers simple, transparent pricing
- Keeps providers' existing operations intact

**Key Differentiator:** By letting providers manage their own delivery (which most already have), we offer the lowest commission in the market while maintaining simplicity.

### **Success Metrics**
- **MVP Launch:** 3 months from project start
- **Year 1 Targets:**
  - 50+ partner restaurants/shops
  - 1,000+ active users
  - 5,000+ orders completed
  - Average delivery time: <45 minutes
  - Customer satisfaction: >4.2/5 stars
  - Provider satisfaction: >4.5/5 stars

## 💰 Business Model

### **Revenue Streams**

1. **Commission on Orders (PRIMARY - ONLY SOURCE)**
   - **5-7% commission** from restaurants on total order value
   - Simple, transparent pricing
   - Lower than competitors (Talabat: 15-20%)
   - Competitive advantage for providers
   - Tiered structure:
     - Small providers (<50 orders/month): 7%
     - Medium providers (50-200 orders/month): 6%
     - Large providers (200+ orders/month): 5%

**Note:** Providers handle their own delivery using existing staff. They set their own delivery fees directly with customers. Engezna does NOT charge delivery fees or manage drivers.

2. **Advertising (Future - Phase 2)**
   - Featured restaurant placement: 50-100 EGP/week
   - Banner ads in app: 200-500 EGP/week
   - Sponsored search results: 30-50 EGP/day

3. **Subscription (Future - Phase 3)**
   - Engezna Plus for customers: 49 EGP/month
   - Benefits: Exclusive deals, priority support
   - Provider premium features: 199 EGP/month
   - Benefits: Advanced analytics, marketing tools

### **Cost Structure**

#### **Fixed Costs**
- Solo developer salary/living costs
- Infrastructure (Vercel, Supabase): ~$200/month
- Office/workspace: ~1,000 EGP/month  
- Marketing budget: 5,000-10,000 EGP/month
- Legal and accounting: 2,000 EGP/month
- **Total Fixed:** ~15,000-20,000 EGP/month

#### **Variable Costs**
- Payment processing fees (2-3% on online payments)
- SMS notifications (~0.05 EGP/SMS)
- Customer support (as needed)
- Refunds and adjustments (rare)
- Server costs (scales with usage)

**Note:** No driver costs - providers manage their own delivery staff and delivery fees.

### **Financial Projections (Year 1)**

**Model:** 6% average commission (middle tier)

**Conservative Scenario:**
- Average order value: 80 EGP
- Orders per month: 1,000 (Month 3) → 5,000 (Month 12)
- Commission: 6% average = 4.80 EGP per order
- Monthly revenue (Month 12): 5,000 × 4.80 = ~24,000 EGP
- Annual revenue: ~180,000 EGP
- Profit margin: ~60% after costs = ~108,000 EGP/year

**Optimistic Scenario:**
- Orders per month: 2,000 (Month 3) → 10,000 (Month 12)
- Monthly revenue (Month 12): 10,000 × 4.80 = ~48,000 EGP
- Annual revenue: ~360,000 EGP  
- Profit margin: ~65% after costs = ~234,000 EGP/year

**Break-even Point:**
- Fixed costs: ~18,000 EGP/month
- Orders needed: 3,750 orders/month (at 4.80 EGP commission)
- Expected: Month 6-7

**Key Advantages:**
- Lower commission = more providers
- No delivery infrastructure costs
- Simple, predictable revenue
- High profit margins
