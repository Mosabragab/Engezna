### 1.2 Animated Logo (NEW! - v2.0)

**Primary Animated Logo:**
- Font: **Aref Ruqaa** (Arabic Calligraphy Style)
- Text: "إنجزنا"
- Color: **#0F172A (Charcoal)** - NOT the brand blue
- Animation: RTL reveal (right-to-left, mimicking Arabic writing)
- Duration: 1.8 seconds

**Animation Concept:**
The animated logo reveals the Arabic text "إنجزنا" character by character from right to left, as if being written by an invisible pen. This creates an elegant calligraphic effect that:
- Respects Arabic reading direction (RTL)
- Creates a memorable brand impression
- Conveys sophistication and authenticity

**When to Use Animated Logo:**
- App splash screens
- Website hero sections
- Marketing videos intro/outro
- Social media intros
- Loading screens

**When to Use Static Logo:**
- Navigation headers
- Footer
- App icons
- Print materials
- Small sizes (below 24px)

**Size Specifications:**

| Context | Size | Font Size | With Pen |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| Splash Screen | 2xl | 72px | Yes |
| Hero Section | xl | 56px | Optional |
| Large Display | lg | 42px | Optional |
| Standard | md | 30px | No |
| Header/Nav | sm | 24px | No |
| Minimal | xs | 18px | No |

**Optional Pen Decoration:**
- A small pen icon (🖊️ or similar) can appear on the left side of the logo
- Only use with sizes `lg` and above
- Adds a calligraphy/writing visual metaphor

### 1.3 Clear Space & Minimum Size

- Minimum size:
  - Mobile: 24px height for icon-only, 32px for wordmark.
  - Web: 40px height recommended.
  - Animated logo: Minimum 30px (md size) for visibility of animation.

- Shape: Rounded square.
- Background: `#009DE0`.

The goal: recognisable at 48x48px on low-end Android screens.

### 2.2 Favicon & Small Iconography

- Use simplified "E" or "إ" inside a blue circle for favicon.
- Ensure contrast and sharp edges at 16x16 / 32x32.

**Safe Combinations:**
- Primary blue on white.

**Avoid:**
